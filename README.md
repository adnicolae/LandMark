## Overview
Landmark suggestions based on the user's current location. </br>
Suggestions are user-generated and are available as items in a list and as pins on the map. </br>
Each suggestion contains a photo, directions and a description of the location.

## Idea / Goal
The goal is to use an online database such that every user can access other users's suggestions and feedback.

## Demo - local SQLite database with dummy data
